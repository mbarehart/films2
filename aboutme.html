                <p> I'm a former teacher who decided it was time for a change. So I 
                    learned some code and decided to combine my interest in movies and exploration 
                    to create this site. I'm starting with day trips around and near east Tennessee. 
                    Hopefully, when Covid things settle, I'll be able to branch out. Enjoy!
