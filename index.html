                <p>Quarentine hit, and to stave off bordom and depression, 
                I decided to learn some coding skills. To practice those skills,
                I made this site. I take day trips to filming locations for various 
                movies and provide you with pictures and info on the areas along with 
                a movie review. I hope you enjoy!

                    <p><em>Big Fish</em> is directed by Tim Burton. The movie rovolves around estranged father (Edward) and son (Will). Edward is dying from cancer and Will returns to his parents' home to spend time with his father. The father and son reconnect as Edward recounts stories from his life with as much exaggeration and fantasy as you can expect from a movie named <em>Big Fish.</em> Tim Burton's dazzling visuals keep you engaged throughout the fantasy filled flashbacks, and allow you to feel the heartfelt moments.  Check out the trailer below.<br>

                    I have been waiting to go to Jackson Lake Island in Elmore County, Alabama for some time now. In addition to good kayaking, fishing, and goats, it is also the filming location for the Town of Spectre.
