                    <p><em>A Walk in the Woods</em> stars RobertRed as 
                    Bill Bryson, an aging travel writer recently returnd to the USA. His 
                wife (played by Emma Thompson) isn't to keen on the idea, citing his 
                age as a major problem. She insists he does not go alone. Bill's old travel buddy 
                Steven Katz (Nick Nolte) decides to join. They start at the Georgia end of the
                 trai in April. Bonding and adventure ensue. You can see the trailer below. <br>

                    There are some lovely mountain views along the hike. Along the hike,
                    our characters see some lovely views and stop in some towns along the 
                    way for a rest. One of the places they see in their travels is Fontana Dam. 
                    Fontana Dam is the tallest dam in the eastern U.S. It is located in North Carolina
                    just outside of the Tennessee border. The Appalachian Trail crosses over the 
                    top of the dam. I was lucky enought to vist the my first time when the flood 
                    gates were open. The video doesn't begin to capture the awe and power of the water 
                    spewing forth.
